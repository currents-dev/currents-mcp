# Currents MCP Server

This is a MCP server that allows you to provide test results context to your AI agents by connecting them to Currents. Useful for asking AI to fix or optimize tests failing in CI.

### ⚠️ Notice
By connecting AI tools (e.g., via MCP) to Currents, you are granting them access to your API key, test results and CI metadata. It is your responsibility to vet any AI agents or services you use, and to ensure they handle your data securely.


## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds—bug fixes, features, and documentation updates!

### Quick Start

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/currents-mcp.git
   cd currents-mcp
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   You should see: `Currents MCP Server running on stdio`.

### Local Development with a Client (optional)

To test with a local MCP client (e.g., Cursor or Claude Desktop), point the client to your built server:

- Command: `node`
- Args: `./mcp-server/build/index.js`
- Env: set `CURRENTS_API_KEY` to a valid key

Example snippet for a client config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "currents": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "CURRENTS_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Making Changes

- Create a feature branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feat/short-description
